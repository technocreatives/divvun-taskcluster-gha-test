# Introduction

A separate repo where new github actions can be tested before modifying (and potentially breaking) the [real repo](https://github.com/divvun/taskcluster-gha).

# Building

Run `npm run build` before comitting, commit any additions to `node_modules`, as Github Actions requires all modules to be installed.

# Actions
